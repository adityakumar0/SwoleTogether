# Swole Together

A workout tracker whose key differentiating feature is the ability to
simultaneously track lifts for two partners on the same program.

## MVP

```
As a trainee with a workout partner
We want to be able to write the weight each of us used for a 5-rep set of bench press
So that we can use a single input for both our weights
```

```
As a trainee with a workout partner
We want to be able to revisit the results of our bench-press set later on
So that we can track our progress together
```

## Sketch

Something like a table with the following:

```
Lift        | Reps | My Weight    | Partner's Weight |
------------+------+--------------+------------------+-----------------
Bench Press | 5    | <text input> | <text input>     | <submit button>
```

and the site should remember this single set forever.
